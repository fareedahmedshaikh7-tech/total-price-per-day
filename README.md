Total Price Calculation per Day â€“ Mini Project

Overview
This is a beginner-friendly project demonstrating how to use NumPy and Pandas to calculate total sales per day across multiple items.  
The project applies the dot product concept to a real world style dataset.

Steps Performed
1. Created a DataFrame of item quantities for each weekday.
2. Defined a price list for each item.
3. Applied dot product (NumPy) to calculate total sales per day.
4. Appended results back into the Pandas DataFrame for clarity.

Key Insights
- Thursday had the highest sales (1242).  
- Wednesday had the lowest sales (383).  
- Item2 (price = 29) had the largest influence on daily totals.  

Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

How to Run
1. Install required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas

Open the notebook in Jupyter:
jupyter notebook Total_price_calculation_per_day.ipynb

Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.
